LibSass currently expects all input to be utf8 encoded (and outputs only utf8), if you actually have any unicode characters at all. We do not support conversion between encodings, even if you declare it with a `@charset` rule. The text below was originally posted as an [issue](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"exotic" codepages!~~

I guess the biggest Problem is to have libiconv/ICU (or some other) library as a dependency. Since it contains a lot of rules for the conversions, I see it as the only way to handle this correctly. Once that is sorted out it should be pretty much straight forward to implement the missing pieces (in parser.cpp - Parser::parse should return encoding and add Parser::sniff_charset, then convert the source byte stream to UTF-8).

I hope the statements above all hold true. Unicode is really not the easiest topic to wrap your head around. But since I did all the above recently in Perl, I wanted to document it here. Feel free to extend or criticize.
