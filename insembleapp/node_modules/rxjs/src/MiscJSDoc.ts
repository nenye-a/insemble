   * Creates a new Observable, that will execute the specified function when an
   * {@link Observer} subscribes to it.
   *
   * <span class="informal">Create custom Observable, that does whatever you like.</span>
   *
   * ![](create.png)
   *
   * `create` converts an `onSubscription` function to an actual Observable.
   * Whenever someone subscribes to that Observable, the function will be called
   * with an {@link Observer} instance as a first and only parameter. `onSubscription` should
   * then invoke the Observers `next`, `error` and `complete` methods.
   *
   * Calling `next` with a value will emit that value to the observer. Calling `complete`
   * means that Observable finished emitting and will not do anything else.
   * Calling `error` means that something went wrong - value passed to `error` method should
   * provide details on what exactly happened.
   *
   * A well-formed Observable can emit as many values as it needs via `next` method,
   * but `complete` and `error` methods can be called only once and nothing else can be called
   * thereafter. If you try to invoke `next`, `complete` or `error` methods after created
   * Observable already completed or ended with an error, these calls will be ignored to
   * preserve so called *Observable Contract*. Note that you are not required to call
   * `complete` at any point - it is perfectly fine to create an Observable that never ends,
   * depending on your needs.
   *
   * `onSubscription` can optionally return either a function or an object with
   * `unsubscribe` method. In both cases function or method will be called when
   * subscription to Observable is being cancelled and should be used to clean up all
   * resources. So, for example, if you are using `setTimeout` in your custom
   * Observable, when someone unsubscribes, you can clear planned timeout, so that
   * it does not fire needlessly and browser (or other environment) does not waste
   * computing power on timing event that no one will listen to anyways.
   *
   * Most of the times you should not need to use `create`, because existing
   * operators allow you to create an Observable for most of the use cases.
   * That being said, `create` is low-level mechanism allowing you to create
   * any Observable, if you have very specific needs.
   *
   * **TypeScript signature issue**
   *
   * Because Observable extends class which already has defined static `create` function,
   * but with different type signature, it was impossible to assign proper signature to
   * `Observable.create`. Because of that, it has very general type `Function` and thus
   * function passed to `create` will not be type checked, unless you explicitly state
   * what signature it should have.
   *
   * When using TypeScript we recommend to declare type signature of function passed to
   * `create` as `(observer: Observer) => TeardownLogic`, where {@link Observer}
   * and {@link TeardownLogic} are interfaces provided by the library.
   *
   * @example <caption>Emit three numbers, then complete.</caption>
   * var observable = Rx.Observable.create(function (observer) {
   *   observer.next(1);
   *   observer.next(2);
   *   observer.next(3);
   *   observer.complete();
   * });
   * observable.subscribe(
   *   value => console.log(value),
   *   err => {},
   *   () => console.log('this is the end')
   * );
   *
   * // Logs
   * // 1
   * // 2
   * // 3
   * // "this is the end"
   *
   *
   * @example <caption>Emit an error</caption>
   * const observable = Rx.Observable.create((observer) => {
   *   observer.error('something went really wrong...');
   * });
   *
   * observable.subscribe(
   *   value => console.log(value), // will never be called
   *   err => console.log(err),
   *   () => console.log('complete') // will never be called

   * @example <caption>Return unsubscribe function</caption>

   *   const id = setTimeout(() => observer.next('...'), 5000); // emit value after 5s
   *
   *   return () => { clearTimeout(id); console.log('cleared!'); };
   * });
   *
   * const subscription = observable.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
