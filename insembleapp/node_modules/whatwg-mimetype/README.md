# Parse, serialize, and manipulate MIME types

This package will parse [MIME types](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"whatwg-mimetype/parser");
const serialize = require("whatwg-mimetype/serialize");
```

`parse(string)` returns an object containing the `type` and `subtype` strings, plus `parameters`, which is a `Map`. This is roughly our equivalent of the spec's [MIME type record](https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#mime-type). If parsing fails, it instead returns `null`.

`serialize(record)` operates on the such an object, giving back a string according to the serialization algorithm.
