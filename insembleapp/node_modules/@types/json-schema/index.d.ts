     *
     * This provides a definition for additional items in an array instance
     * when tuple definitions of the items is provided.  This can be false
     * to indicate additional items in the array are not allowed, or it can
     * be a schema that defines the schema of the additional items.

     * @see DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"maximum".
     * @see DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"minimum".
     * @see DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"items" is an array of schemas, validation succeeds if every instance element
     * at a position greater than the size of "items" validates against "additionalItems".
     * Otherwise, "additionalItems" MUST be ignored, as the "items" schema
     * (possibly the default value of an empty schema) is applied to all elements.
     * Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as an empty schema.
     * @see DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"maxItems" if its size is greater than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.
     * Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of 0.
     * @see DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"contains" if at least one of its elements is valid against the given schema.
     * @see DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"maxProperties" if its number of properties is greater than,
     * or equal to, the value of this keyword.
     * Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of 0.
