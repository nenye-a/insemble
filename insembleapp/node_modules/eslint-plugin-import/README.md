[![build status](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"settings": {
  "import/extensions": [
    ".js",
    ".jsx"
  ]
}
```

If you require more granular extension definitions, you can use:

```js
"settings": {
  "import/resolver": {
    "node": {
      "extensions": [
        ".js",
        ".jsx"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that this is different from (and likely a subset of) any `import/resolver`
extensions settings, which may include `.json`, `.coffee`, etc. which will still
factor into the `no-unresolved` rule.

Also, the following `import/ignore` patterns will overrule this list.

#### `import/ignore`

A list of regex strings that, if matched by a path, will
not report the matching module if no `export`s are found.
In practice, this means rules other than [`no-unresolved`](./docs/rules/no-unresolved.md#ignore) will not report on any
`import`s with (absolute filesystem) paths matching this pattern.

`no-unresolved` has its own [`ignore`](./docs/rules/no-unresolved.md#ignore) setting.

```yaml
settings:
  import/ignore:
    - \.coffee$          # fraught with parse errors
    - \.(scss|less|css)$ # can't parse unprocessed CSS modules, either
```

#### `import/core-modules`

An array of additional modules to consider as "core" modules--modules that should
be considered resolved but have no path on the filesystem. Your resolver may
already define some of these (for example, the Node resolver knows about `fs` and
`path`), so you need not redefine those.

For example, Electron exposes an `electron` module:

```js
import 'electron'  // without extra config, will be flagged as unresolved!
```

that would otherwise be unresolved. To avoid this, you may provide `electron` as a
core module:

```yaml
# .eslintrc.yml
settings:
  import/core-modules: [ electron ]
```

In Electron's specific case, there is a shared config named `electron`
that specifies this for you.

Contribution of more such shared configs for other platforms are welcome!

#### `import/external-module-folders`

An array of folders. Resolved modules only from those folders will be considered as "external". By default - `["node_modules"]`. Makes sense if you have configured your path or webpack to handle your internal paths differently and want to considered modules from some folders, for example `bower_components` or `jspm_modules`, as "external".

#### `import/parsers`

A map from parsers to file extension arrays. If a file extension is matched, the
dependency parser will require and use the map key as the parser instead of the
configured ESLint parser. This is useful if you're inter-op-ing with TypeScript
directly using webpack, for example:

```yaml
# .eslintrc.yml
settings:
  import/parsers:
    @typescript-eslint/parser: [ .ts, .tsx ]
```

In this case, [`@typescript-eslint/parser`](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"folders":
    [
        {
            "path": "code"
        }
    ],
    "SublimeLinter":
    {
        "linters":
        {
            "eslint":
            {
                "chdir": "${project}/code"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note that `${project}/code` matches the `code` provided at `folders[0].path`.

The purpose of the `chdir` setting, in this case, is to set the working directory
from which ESLint is executed to be the same as the directory on which SublimeLinter-eslint
bases the relative path it provides.

See the SublimeLinter docs on [`chdir`](http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/latest/linter_settings.html#chdir)
for more information, in case this does not work with your project.

If you are not using `.eslintignore`, or don't have a Sublime project file, you can also
do the following via a `.sublimelinterrc` file in some ancestor directory of your
code:

```json
{
  "linters": {
    "eslint": {
      "args": ["--stdin-filename", "@"]
    }
  }
}
```

I also found that I needed to set `rc_search_limit` to `null`, which removes the file
hierarchy search limit when looking up the directory tree for `.sublimelinterrc`:

In Package Settings / SublimeLinter / User Settings:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "rc_search_limit": null
  }
}
```

I believe this defaults to `3`, so you may not need to alter it depending on your
project folder max depth.
