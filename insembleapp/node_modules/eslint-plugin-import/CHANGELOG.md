## [2.2.0] - 2016-11-07
### Fixed
- Corrected a few gaffs in the auto-ignore logic to fix major performance issues
  with projects that did not explicitly ignore `node_modules`. ([#654])
- [`import/ignore` setting] was only being respected if the ignored module didn't start with
  an `import` or `export` JS statement
- [`prefer-default-export`]: fixed crash on export extensions ([#653])

## [2.1.0] - 2016-11-02

- Add [`no-named-default`] rule: style-guide rule to report use of unnecessarily named default imports ([#596], thanks [@ntdb])
- [`no-extraneous-dependencies`]: check globs against CWD + absolute path ([#602] + [#630], thanks [@ljharb])

### Fixed
- [`prefer-default-export`] handles flow `export type` ([#484] + [#639], thanks [@jakubsta])
- [`prefer-default-export`] handles re-exported default exports ([#609])
- Fix crash when using [`newline-after-import`] with decorators ([#592])
- Properly report [`newline-after-import`] when next line is a decorator
- Fixed documentation for the default values for the [`order`] rule ([#601])

## [2.0.1] - 2016-10-06
### Fixed
- Fixed code that relied on removed dependencies. ([#604])

## [2.0.0]! - 2016-09-30
### Added
- [`unambiguous`] rule: report modules that are not unambiguously ES modules.
- `recommended` shared config. Roughly `errors` and `warnings` mixed together,
  with some `parserOptions` in the mix. ([#402])
- `react` shared config: added `jsx: true` to `parserOptions.ecmaFeatures`.
- Added [`no-webpack-loader-syntax`] rule: forbid custom Webpack loader syntax in imports. ([#586], thanks [@fson]!)
- Add option `newlines-between: "ignore"` to [`order`] ([#519])
- Added [`no-unassigned-import`] rule ([#529])

### Breaking
- [`import/extensions` setting] defaults to `['.js']`. ([#306])
- [`import/ignore` setting] defaults to nothing, and ambiguous modules are ignored natively. This means importing from CommonJS modules will no longer be reported by [`default`], [`named`], or [`namespace`], regardless of `import/ignore`. ([#270])
- [`newline-after-import`]: Removed need for an empty line after an inline `require` call ([#570])
- [`order`]: Default value for `newlines-between` option is now `ignore` ([#519])

### Changed
- `imports-first` is renamed to [`first`]. `imports-first` alias will continue to
  exist, but may be removed in a future major release.
- Case-sensitivity: now specifically (and optionally) reported by [`no-unresolved`].
  Other rules will ignore case-mismatches on paths on case-insensitive filesystems. ([#311])

### Fixed
- [`no-internal-modules`]: support `@`-scoped packages ([#577]+[#578], thanks [@spalger])

## [1.16.0] - 2016-09-22
### Added
- Added [`no-dynamic-require`] rule: forbid `require()` calls with expressions. ([#567], [#568])
- Added [`no-internal-modules`] rule: restrict deep package imports to specific folders. ([#485], thanks [@spalger]!)
- [`extensions`]: allow override of a chosen default with options object ([#555], thanks [@ljharb]!)

### Fixed
- [`no-named-as-default`] no longer false-positives on `export default from '...'` ([#566], thanks [@preco21])
- [`default`]: allow re-export of values from ignored files as default ([#545], thanks [@skyrpex])

## [1.15.0] - 2016-09-12
### Added
- Added an `allow` option to [`no-nodejs-modules`] to allow exceptions ([#452], [#509]).
- Added [`no-absolute-path`] rule ([#530], [#538])
- [`max-dependencies`] for specifying the maximum number of dependencies (both `import` and `require`) a module can have. (see [#489], thanks [@tizmagik])
- Added glob option to config for [`no-extraneous-dependencies`], after much bikeshedding. Thanks, [@knpwrs]! ([#527])

### Fixed
- [`no-named-as-default-member`] Allow default import to have a property named "default" ([#507], [#508], thanks [@jquense] for both!)

## [1.14.0] - 2016-08-22
### Added
- [`import/parsers` setting]: parse some dependencies (i.e. TypeScript!) with a different parser than the ESLint-configured parser. ([#503])

### Fixed
- [`namespace`] exception for get property from `namespace` import, which are re-export from commonjs module ([#499] fixes [#416], thanks [@wKich])

## [1.13.0] - 2016-08-11
### Added
- `allowComputed` option for [`namespace`] rule. If set to `true`, won't report
  computed member references to namespaces. (see [#456])

### Changed
- Modified [`no-nodejs-modules`] error message to include the module's name ([#453], [#461])

### Fixed
- [`import/extensions` setting] is respected in spite of the appearance of imports
  in an imported file. (fixes [#478], thanks [@rhys-vdw])

## [1.12.0] - 2016-07-26
### Added
- [`import/external-module-folders` setting]: a possibility to configure folders for "external" modules ([#444], thanks [@zloirock])

## [1.11.1] - 2016-07-20
### Fixed
- [`newline-after-import`] exception for `switch` branches with `require`s iff parsed as `sourceType:'module'`.
  (still [#441], thanks again [@ljharb])

## [1.11.0] - 2016-07-17
### Added
- Added an `peerDependencies` option to [`no-extraneous-dependencies`] to allow/forbid peer dependencies ([#423], [#428], thanks [@jfmengels]!).

### Fixed
- [`newline-after-import`] exception for multiple `require`s in an arrow
  function expression (e.g. `() => require('a') || require('b')`). ([#441], thanks [@ljharb])

## [1.10.3] - 2016-07-08
### Fixed
- removing `Symbol` dependencies (i.e. `for-of` loops) due to Node 0.10 polyfill
  issue (see [#415]). Should not make any discernible semantic difference.

## [1.10.2] - 2016-07-04
### Fixed
- Something horrible happened during `npm prepublish` of 1.10.1.
  Several `rm -rf node_modules && npm i` and `gulp clean && npm prepublish`s later, it is rebuilt and republished as 1.10.2. Thanks [@rhettlivingston] for noticing and reporting!

## [1.10.1] - 2016-07-02 [YANKED]
### Added
- Officially support ESLint 3.x. (peerDependencies updated to `2.x - 3.x`)

## [1.10.0] - 2016-06-30
### Added
- Added new rule [`no-restricted-paths`]. ([#155]/[#371], thanks [@lo1tuma])
- [`import/core-modules` setting]: allow configuration of additional module names,
  to be treated as builtin modules (a la `path`, etc. in Node). ([#275] + [#365], thanks [@sindresorhus] for driving)
- React Native shared config (based on comment from [#283])

### Fixed
- Fixed crash with `newline-after-import` related to the use of switch cases. (fixes [#386], thanks [@ljharb] for reporting) ([#395])

## [1.9.2] - 2016-06-21
### Fixed
- Issues with ignored/CJS files in [`export`] and [`no-deprecated`] rules. ([#348], [#370])

## [1.9.1] - 2016-06-16
### Fixed
- Reordered precedence for loading resolvers. ([#373])

## [1.9.0] - 2016-06-10

- Added support TomDoc comments to [`no-deprecated`]. ([#321], thanks [@josh])
- Added support for loading custom resolvers ([#314], thanks [@le0nik])

### Fixed
- [`prefer-default-export`] handles `export function` and `export const` in same file ([#359], thanks [@scottnonnenberg])

## [1.8.1] - 2016-05-23
### Fixed
- `export * from 'foo'` now properly ignores a `default` export from `foo`, if any. ([#328]/[#332], thanks [@jkimbo])
  This impacts all static analysis of imported names. ([`default`], [`named`], [`namespace`], [`export`])
- Make [`order`]'s `newline-between` option handle multiline import statements ([#313], thanks [@singles])
- Make [`order`]'s `newline-between` option handle not assigned import statements ([#313], thanks [@singles])
- Make [`order`]'s `newline-between` option ignore `require` statements inside object literals ([#313], thanks [@singles])
- [`prefer-default-export`] properly handles deep destructuring, `export * from ...`, and files with no exports. ([#342]+[#343], thanks [@scottnonnenberg])

## [1.8.0] - 2016-05-11
### Added
- [`prefer-default-export`], new rule. ([#308], thanks [@gavriguy])

### Fixed
- Ignore namespace / ES7 re-exports in [`no-mutable-exports`]. ([#317], fixed by [#322]. thanks [@borisyankov] + [@jfmengels])
- Make [`no-extraneous-dependencies`] handle scoped packages ([#316], thanks [@jfmengels])

## [1.7.0] - 2016-05-06
### Added
- [`newline-after-import`], new rule. ([#245], thanks [@singles])
- Added an `optionalDependencies` option to [`no-extraneous-dependencies`] to allow/forbid optional dependencies ([#266], thanks [@jfmengels]).
- Added `newlines-between` option to [`order`] rule ([#298], thanks [@singles])
- add [`no-mutable-exports`] rule ([#290], thanks [@josh])
- [`import/extensions` setting]: a list of file extensions to parse as modules
  and search for `export`s. If unspecified, all extensions are considered valid (for now).
  In v2, this will likely default to `['.js', MODULE_EXT]`. ([#297], to fix [#267])

### Fixed
- [`extensions`]: fallback to source path for extension enforcement if imported
  module is not resolved. Also, never report for builtins (i.e. `path`). ([#296])

## [1.6.1] - 2016-04-28
### Fixed
- [`no-named-as-default-member`]: don't crash on rest props. ([#281], thanks [@SimenB])
- support for Node 6: don't pass `null` to `path` functions.
  Thanks to [@strawbrary] for bringing this up ([#272]) and adding OSX support to the Travis
  config ([#288]).

## [1.6.0] - 2016-04-25
### Added
- add [`no-named-as-default-member`] to `warnings` canned config
- add [`no-extraneous-dependencies`] rule ([#241], thanks [@jfmengels])
- add [`extensions`] rule ([#250], thanks [@lo1tuma])
- add [`no-nodejs-modules`] rule ([#261], thanks [@jfmengels])
- add [`order`] rule ([#247], thanks [@jfmengels])
- consider `resolve.fallback` config option in the webpack resolver ([#254])

### Changed
- [`imports-first`] now allows directives (i.e. `'use strict'`) strictly before
  any imports ([#256], thanks [@lemonmade])

### Fixed
- [`named`] now properly ignores the source module if a name is re-exported from
  an ignored file (i.e. `node_modules`). Also improved the reported error. (thanks to [@jimbolla] for reporting)
- [`no-named-as-default-member`] had a crash on destructuring in loops (thanks for heads up from [@lemonmade])

## [1.5.0] - 2016-04-18
### Added
- report resolver errors at the top of the linted file
- add [`no-namespace`] rule ([#239], thanks [@singles])
- add [`no-named-as-default-member`] rule ([#243], thanks [@dmnd])

### Changed
- Rearranged rule groups in README in preparation for more style guide rules

### Removed
- support for Node 0.10, via `es6-*` ponyfills. Using native Map/Set/Symbol.

## [1.4.0] - 2016-03-25
### Added
- Resolver plugin interface v2: more explicit response format that more clearly covers the found-but-core-module case, where there is no path.
  Still backwards-compatible with the original version of the resolver spec.
- [Resolver documentation](./resolvers/README.md)

### Changed
- using `package.json/files` instead of `.npmignore` for package file inclusion ([#228], thanks [@mathieudutour])
- using `es6-*` ponyfills instead of `babel-runtime`

## [1.3.0] - 2016-03-20
Major perf improvements. Between parsing only once and ignoring gigantic, non-module `node_modules`,
there is very little added time.

My test project takes 17s to lint completely, down from 55s, when using the
memoizing parser, and takes only 27s with naked `babel-eslint` (thus, reparsing local modules).

### Added
- This change log ([#216])
- Experimental memoizing [parser](./memo-parser/README.md)

### Fixed
- Huge reduction in execution time by _only_ ignoring [`import/ignore` setting] if
  something that looks like an `export` is detected in the module content.

## [1.2.0] - 2016-03-19
Thanks [@lencioni] for identifying a huge amount of rework in resolve and kicking
off a bunch of memoization.

I'm seeing 62% improvement over my normal test codebase when executing only
[`no-unresolved`] in isolation, and ~35% total reduction in lint time.

### Changed
- added caching to core/resolve via [#214], configured via [`import/cache` setting]

## [1.1.0] - 2016-03-15
### Added
- Added an [`ignore`](./docs/rules/no-unresolved.md#ignore) option to [`no-unresolved`] for those pesky files that no
resolver can find. (still prefer enhancing the Webpack and Node resolvers to
using it, though). See [#89] for details.

## [1.0.4] - 2016-03-11
### Changed
- respect hoisting for deep namespaces ([`namespace`]/[`no-deprecated`]) ([#211])

### Fixed
- don't crash on self references ([#210])
- correct cache behavior in `eslint_d` for deep namespaces ([#200])

## [1.0.3] - 2016-02-26
### Changed
- no-deprecated follows deep namespaces ([#191])

### Fixed
- [`namespace`] no longer flags modules with only a default export as having no
names. (ns.default is valid ES6)

## [1.0.2] - 2016-02-26
### Fixed
- don't parse imports with no specifiers ([#192])

## [1.0.1] - 2016-02-25
### Fixed
- export `stage-0` shared config
- documented [`no-deprecated`]
- deep namespaces are traversed regardless of how they get imported ([#189])

## [1.0.0] - 2016-02-24
### Added
- [`no-deprecated`]: WIP rule to let you know at lint time if you're using
deprecated functions, constants, classes, or modules.

### Changed
- [`namespace`]: support deep namespaces ([#119] via [#157])

## [1.0.0-beta.0] - 2016-02-13
### Changed
- support for (only) ESLint 2.x
- no longer needs/refers to `import/parser` or `import/parse-options`. Instead,
ESLint provides the configured parser + options to the rules, and they use that
to parse dependencies.

### Removed
- `babylon` as default import parser (see Breaking)

## [0.13.0] - 2016-02-08
### Added
- [`no-commonjs`] rule
- [`no-amd`] rule

### Removed
- Removed vestigial `no-require` rule. [`no-commonjs`] is more complete.

## [0.12.2] - 2016-02-06 [YANKED]
Unpublished from npm and re-released as 0.13.0. See [#170].

## [0.12.1] - 2015-12-17
### Changed
- Broke docs for rules out into individual files.

## [0.12.0] - 2015-12-14
### Changed
- Ignore [`import/ignore` setting] if exports are actually found in the parsed module. Does
this to support use of `jsnext:main` in `node_modules` without the pain of
managing an allow list or a nuanced deny list.

## [0.11.0] - 2015-11-27
### Added
- Resolver plugins. Now the linter can read Webpack config, properly follow
aliases and ignore externals, dismisses inline loaders, etc. etc.!
