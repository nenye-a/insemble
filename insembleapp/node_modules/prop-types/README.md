# prop-types

Runtime type checking for React props and similar objects.

You can use prop-types to document the intended types of properties passed to
components. React (and potentially other libraries—see the checkPropTypes()
reference below) will check props passed to your components against those
definitions, and warn in development if they don’t match.

## Installation

```shell
npm install --save prop-types
```

## Importing

```js
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; // ES6
var PropTypes = require('prop-types'); // ES5 with npm
```

If you prefer a `<script>` tag, you can get it from `window.PropTypes` global:

```html
<!-- development version -->
<script src="DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS
