# eslint-plugin-babel

An `eslint` plugin companion to `babel-eslint`. `babel-eslint` does a great job at adapting `eslint`
for use with Babel, but it can't change the built in rules to support experimental features.
`eslint-plugin-babel` re-implements problematic rules so they do not give false positives or negatives.

> Requires Node 4 or greater

### Install

```sh
npm install eslint-plugin-babel --save-dev
```

Load the plugin in your `.eslintrc` file:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "babel"
  ]
}
```

Finally enable all the rules you would like to use (remember to disable the
original ones as well!).

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "babel/new-cap": 1,
    "babel/camelcase": 1,
    "babel/no-invalid-this": 1,
    "babel/object-curly-spacing": 1,
    "babel/quotes": 1,
    "babel/semi": 1,
    "babel/no-unused-expressions": 1,
    "babel/valid-typeof": 1
  }
}
```
### Rules

Each rule corresponds to a core `eslint` rule, and has the same options.

ðŸ› : means it's autofixable with `--fix`.

- `babel/new-cap`: Ignores capitalized decorators (`@Decorator`)
- `babel/camelcase: doesn't complain about optional chaining (`var foo = bar?.a_b;`)
- `babel/no-invalid-this`: doesn't fail when inside class properties (`class A { a = this.b; }`)
- `babel/object-curly-spacing`: doesn't complain about `export x from "mod";` or `export * as x from "mod";` (ðŸ› )
- `babel/quotes`: doesn't complain about JSX fragment shorthand syntax (`<>foo</>;`)
- `babel/semi`: doesn't fail when using `for await (let something of {})`. Includes class properties (ðŸ› )
- `babel/no-unused-expressions`: doesn't fail when using `do` expressions or [optional chaining](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS
