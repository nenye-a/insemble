Tweak React components in real time ‚öõÔ∏è‚ö°Ô∏è

Watch
**[Dan Abramov's talk on Hot Reloading with Time Travel](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"on mount" hook. "Not changing the past"
üî• useEffect(effect, [anyDep]); // would be updated

üî• useEffect(effect, ["hot"]); // the simplest way to make hook reloadable
```

**Plus**

* any hook would be reloaded on a function body change. Enabled by default, controlled by `reloadHooksOnBodyChange` option.
* you may configure RHL to reload any hook by setting `reloadLifeCycleHooks` option to true.

**To disable hooks reloading** - set configuration option:

```js
import { setConfig } from 'react-hot-loader';

setConfig({
  reloadHooks: false,
});
```

With this option set **all** `useEffects`, `useCallbacks` and `useMemo` would be updated on Hot Module Replacement.

### Hooks reset

Hooks would be reset if their order changes. Adding, removing or moving around would
cause a local tree remount.

**Babel plugin is required** for this operation. Without it changing hook order would throw an error
which would be propagated till the nearest class-based component.

## `@hot-loader/react-dom`

[`@hot-loader/react-dom`](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"mode" and "entry", too.
  resolve: { extensions: [".ts", ".tsx", ".js", ".jsx"] },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(j|t)sx?$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
          options: {
            cacheDirectory: true,
            babelrc: false,
            presets: [
              [
                "@babel/preset-env",
                { targets: { browsers: "last 2 versions" } } // or whatever your project requires
              ],
              "@babel/preset-typescript",
              "@babel/preset-react"
            ],
            plugins: [
              // plugin-proposal-decorators is only needed if you're using experimental decorators in TypeScript
              ["@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators", { legacy: true }],
              ["@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties", { loose: true }],
              "react-hot-loader/babel"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin()
  ]
};
```

For a full example configuration of TypeScript with React Hot Loader and newest beta version of Babel, check [here](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"cold API" [to all node_modules](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader#disabling-a-type-change-for-all-node_modules).

> It is safe to enable this loader for all the files. But place it after babel-loader, if babel-loader is present.

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        include: /node_modules/,
        use: ['react-hot-loader/webpack'],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

Webpack plugin will also land a "hot" patch to react-dom, making React-Hot-Loader more compliant to [the principles](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/1118).

If you are using `babel-plugin` you might not need to apply `webpack-loader` to all the files, scoping it to `react-dom`

```js
// would only land a "hot-patch" to react-dom
{
    test: /\.js$/,
    include: /node_modules\/react-dom/,
    use: ['react-hot-loader/webpack']
},
```

### Code Splitting

If you want to use Code Splitting + React Hot Loader, the simplest solution is to pick a library compatible with this one:

* [React Lazy](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy)
* [Imported Component](https://github.com/theKashey/react-imported-component)
* [React Universal Component](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component)
* [React-Loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable)

If you use a not-yet-friendly library, like [react-async-component](github.com/ctrlplusb/react-async-component),
or are having problems with hot reloading failing to reload code-split components,
you can manually mark the components below the code-split boundaries.

```js
// AsyncHello.js
import { asyncComponent } from 'react-async-component';

// asyncComponent could not `hot-reload` itself.
const AsyncHello = asyncComponent({
  resolve: () => import('./Hello'),
});

export default AsyncHello;
```

Note that `Hello` is the component at the root of this particular
code-split chunk.

```js
// Hello.js
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader/root';

const Hello = () => 'Hello';

export default hot(Hello); // <-- module will reload itself
```

Wrapping this root component with `hot()` will ensure that it is hot reloaded correctly.

### Out-of-bound warning
You may see the following warning when code-split components are updated:
```console
React-Hot-Loader: some components were updated out-of-bound. Updating your app to reconcile the changes.
```

This is because the hot reloading of code-split components happens asynchronously. If you had an `App.js` that implemented
the `AsyncHello` component above and you modified `AsyncHello`, it would be bundled and reloaded at the same time as
`App.js`. However, the core hot reloading logic is synchronous, meaning that it's possible for the hot reload to run before
the updates to the split component have landed.

In this case, RHL uses a special _tail update detection_ logic, where it notes that an an update to a split component
has happened after the core hot reloading logic has already finished, and it triggers another update cycle to ensure
that all changes are applied.

The warning is informational - it is a notice that this tail update logic is triggered, and does not indicate a problem
in the configuration or useage of `react-hot-loader`.

If the tail update detection is not something you want or need, you can disable this behavior by setting
`setConfig({ trackTailUpdates:false })`.

### Checking Element `type`s

Because React Hot Loader creates proxied versions of your components, comparing
reference types of elements won't work:

```js
const element = <Component />;
console.log(element.type === Component); // false
```

React Hot Loader exposes a function `areComponentsEqual` to make it possible:

```js
import { areComponentsEqual } from 'react-hot-loader';
const element = <Component />;
areComponentsEqual(element.type, Component); // true
```

Another way - compare "rendered" element type

```js
const element = <Component />;
console.log(element.type === <Component />.type); // true

// better - precache rendered type
const element = <Component />;
const ComponentType = <Component />.type;
console.log(element.type === ComponentType); // true
```

But you might have to provide all required props. See [original issue](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/304).
This is most reliable way to compare components, but it will not work with required props.

Another way - compare Component name.

> Not all components has a name. **In production displayName could not exists.**

```js
const element = <Component />;
console.log(element.displayName === 'Component'); // true
```

This is something we did not solve yet. Cold API could help keep original types.

### Webpack ExtractTextPlugin

webpack ExtractTextPlugin is not compatible with React Hot Loader. Please disable it in development:

```js
new ExtractTextPlugin({
  filename: 'styles/[name].[contenthash].css',
  disable: NODE_ENV !== 'production',
});
```

#### Disabling a type change (‚ùÑÔ∏è)

It is possible to disable React-Hot-Loader for a specific component, especially to
enable common way to type comparison.
See #991 for the idea behind ‚õÑÔ∏è, and #304 about "type comparison" problem.

```js
import { cold } from 'react-hot-loader';

cold(SomeComponent) // this component will ignored by React-Hot-Loader
<SomeComponent />.type === SomeComponent // true
```

If you will update `cold` component React-Hot-Loader will complain (on error level), and then
React will cold-replace Component with a internal state lose.

> Reach-Hot-Loader: cold element got updated

##### Disabling a type change for all node_modules

You may _cold_ all components from node_modules. This will not work for HOC(like Redux) or dynamically created Components, but might help in most of situations, when type changes
are not welcomed, and modules are not expected to change.

```js
import { setConfig, cold } from 'react-hot-loader';
setConfig({
  onComponentRegister: (type, name, file) => file.indexOf('node_modules') > 0 && cold(type),

  // some components are not visible as top level variables,
  // thus its not known where they were created
  onComponentCreate: (type, name) => name.indexOf('styled') > 0 && cold(type),
});
```

! To be able to "cold" components from 'node_modules' you have to apply babel to node_modules, while this
folder is usually excluded.
You may add one more babel-loader, with only one React-Hot-Loader plugin inside to solve this.
**Consider using webpack-loader** for this.

##### React-Hooks

React hooks are not _really_ supported by React-Hot-Loader. Mostly due to our internal
processes of re-rendering React Tree, which is required to reconcile an updated application
before React will try to rerender it, and fail to do that, obviously.

* hooks **should work** for versions 4.6.0 and above (`pureSFC` is enabled by default).
* hooks will produce **errors** on every hot-update without patches to `react-dom`.
* hooks **may loss the state** without patches to `react-dom`.
* hooks does not support adding new hooks on the fly
* change in hooks for a mounted components will cause a runtime exception, and a `retry` button (at the nearest class component) will be shown.
  Pressing a `retry` button will basically remount tree branch.

To mitigate any hook-related issues (and disable their hot-reloadability) - `cold` them.

* _cold_ components using hooks.

```js
import { setConfig, cold } from 'react-hot-loader';
setConfig({
  onComponentCreate: (type, name) =>
    (String(type).indexOf('useState') > 0 || String(type).indexOf('useEffect') > 0) && cold(type),
});
```

## API

### `hot(Component, options)`

Mark a component as hot.

#### Babel plugin

Right now babel plugin has only one option, enabled by default.

* `safetyNet` - will help you properly setup ReactHotLoader.

You may disable it to get more control on the module execution order.

```js
//.babelrc
{
    "plugins": [
        [
            "react-hot-loader/babel",
            {
            "safetyNet": false
            }
        ]
    ]
}
```

#### Important

**!!** Use `hot` only for module `exports`, not for module `imports`. **!!**

```js
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader/root';

const App = () => 'Hello World!';

export default hot(App);
```

Keep in mind - by importing `react-hot-loader/root` you are setting up a boundary for update event propagation.

The higher(in module hierarchy) you have it - the more stuff would be updated on Hot Module Replacement.

To make RHL more reliable and safe, please place `hot` _below_ (ie somewhere in _imported_ modules):

* react-dom
* redux store creation
* any data, you want to preserve between updates
* big libraries

You may(but it's not required) place `hot` to the every route/page/feature/lazy chunk, thus make updates more scoped.

You don't need to wrap every component with `hot`, application work work fine with a single one.

### (old)`hot(module, options)(Component, options)`

Mark a component as hot. The "new" hot is just hidding the first part - `hot(module)`, giving you
only the second `(App)`. The "new" hot is using old API.

```js
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader';

const App = () => 'Hello World!';

export default hot(module)(App);
```

### `AppContainer`

Mark application as hot reloadable. (**Prefer** using `hot` helper, see below for migration details).

This low-level approach lets you make **hot **imports\_\_, not exports.

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { AppContainer } from 'react-hot-loader';
import App from './containers/App';

const render = Component => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <AppContainer>
      <Component />
    </AppContainer>,
    document.getElementById('root'),
  );
};

render(App);

// webpack Hot Module Replacement API
if (module.hot) {
  // keep in mind - here you are configuring HMR to accept CHILDREN MODULE
  // while `hot` would configure HMR for the CURRENT module
  module.hot.accept('./containers/App', () => {
    // if you are using harmony modules ({modules:false})
    render(App);
    // in all other cases - re-require App manually
    render(require('./containers/App'));
  });
}
```

### areComponentsEqual(Component1, Component2)

Test if two components have the same type.

```js
import { areComponentsEqual } from 'react-hot-loader';
import Component1 from './Component1';
import Component2 from './Component2';

areComponentsEqual(Component1, Component2); // true or false
```

### setConfig(config)

Set a new configuration for React Hot Loader.

Available options are:

* `logLevel`: specify log level, default to `"error"`, available values are: `['debug', 'log', 'warn', 'error']`
* `pureSFC`: enable Stateless Functional Component. If disabled they will be converted to React Components.
  Default value: false.
* `ignoreSFC`: skip "patch" for SFC. "Hot loading" could still work, with webpack-patch present
* `pureRender`: do not amend `render` method of any component.
* for the rest see [index.d.ts](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/index.d.ts#L62-L133).

```js
// rhlConfig.js
import { setConfig } from 'react-hot-loader';

setConfig({ logLevel: 'debug' });
```

**It is important** to set configuration before any other action will take a place

```js
// index.js
import './rhlConfig' // <-- extract configuration to a separate file, and import it in the beggining
import React from 'react'
....
```

## Migrating from v3

### AppContainer vs hot

Prior v4 the right way to setup React Hot Loader was to wrap your Application
with `AppContainer`, set setup module acceptance by yourself. This approach is
still valid but only for advanced use cases, prefer using `hot` helper.

**React Hot Loader v3:**

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react';

const App = () => <div>Hello world!</div>;

export default App;
```

```js
// main.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { AppContainer } from 'react-hot-loader';
import App from './containers/App';

const render = Component => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <AppContainer>
      <Component />
    </AppContainer>,
    document.getElementById('root'),
  );
};

render(App);

// webpack Hot Module Replacement API
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./containers/App', () => {
    // if you are using harmony modules ({modules:false})
    render(App);
    // in all other cases - re-require App manually
    render(require('./containers/App'));
  });
}
```

**React Hot Loader v4:**

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader';

const App = () => <div>Hello world!</div>;

export default hot(module)(App);
```

```js
// main.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './containers/App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Patch is optional

> Since 4.0 till 4.8

Code is automatically patched, you can safely remove `react-hot-loader/patch` from your webpack config,
if react-hot-loader is required before React in any other way.

### Error Boundary is inside every component

> Since 4.5.4

On Hot Module Update we will inject `componentDidCatch` and a _special_ `render`
to every Class-based component you have, making [Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#introducing-error-boundaries) more local.

After update we will remove all sugar, keeping only Boundaries you've created.

You can provide your own `errorReporter`, via `setConfig({errorReporter})` or opt-out from
root ErrorBoundaries setting `errorBoundary={false}` prop on `AppContainer` or `hot`.
However - this option affects only SFC behavior, and any ClassComponent would boundary itself.

```js
import { setConfig } from 'react-hot-loader';
import ErrorBoundary from './ErrorBoundary';

// ErrorBoundary will be given error and errorInfo prop.
setConfig({ errorReporter: ErrorBoundary });
```

If `errorReporter` is not set - full screen error overlay would be shown.

#### Setting global Error Reporter

Global Error Reporter would, created a fixed overlay on top the page,
would be used to display errors, not handled by `errorReporter`, and
any HMR error.

You may change, or disable this global error overlay

```js
// to disable
setConfig({ ErrorOverlay: () => null });

// to change
setConfig({ ErrorOverlay: MyErrorOverlay });
```

The UX of existing overlay is a subject to change, and we are open to any proposals.

## Known limitations and side effects

### Note about `hot`

`hot` accepts only React Component (Stateful or Stateless), resulting the `HotExported` variant of it.
The `hot` function will setup current module to _self-accept_ itself on reload, and will **ignore** all the changes, made for non-React components.
You may mark as many modules as you want. But `HotExportedComponent` **should be the only used export** of a _hot_-module.

> Note: Please note how often we have used `exported` keyword. `hot` is for exports.

> Note: Does nothing in production mode, just passes App through.

### New Components keep executing the old code

There is no way to hot-update constructor code, as result even new components
will be born as the first ones, and then grow into the last ones. As of today, this issue cannot be solved.

## Troubleshooting

If it doesn't work, in 99% of cases it's a configuration issue. A missing option, a
wrong path or port. webpack is very strict about configuration, and the best way
to find out what's wrong is to compare your project to an already working setup,
check out
**[examples](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master/examples)**,
bit by bit.

If something doesn't work, in 99% of cases it's an issue with your code. The Component
didn't get registered, due to HOC or Decorator around it, which is making it
invisible to the Babel plugin or webpack loader.

We're also gathering
**[Troubleshooting Recipes](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md)**
so send a PR if you have a lesson to share!

### Switch into debug mode

Debug mode adds additional warnings and can tells you why React Hot Loader is
not working properly in your application.

```js
import { setConfig } from 'react-hot-loader';
setConfig({ logLevel: 'debug' });
```
