### Bug Fixes

* Add temporary fix for stuck processes (see [sass/node-sass#857](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/857)) [#100](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/100) [#119](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/119) [#132](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/pull/132)

* Fix file watchers for files with errors [#134](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/pull/134)


### Code Refactoring

* Refactor [import resolving algorithm](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/DELETED_LONG_HEX_STRING/index.js#L293-L348). ([#138](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/138)) ([c8621a1](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/DELETED_LONG_HEX_STRING))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The new algorithm is aligned to libsass' way of resolving files. This yields to different results if two files with the same path and filename but with different extensions are present. Though this change should be no problem for most users, we must flag it as breaking change.
