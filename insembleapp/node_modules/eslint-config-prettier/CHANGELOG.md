### Version 6.1.0 (2019-08-19)

- Added: [function-call-argument-newline] \(new in ESLint 6.2.0). Thanks to
  Masafumi Koba (@ybiquitous)!

### Version 6.0.0 (2019-06-25)

- Changed: The CLI helper tool now considers [no-confusing-arrow] to conflict
  if you use the default value of its `allowParens` option. The default was
  changed to `true` in ESLint 6, which conflicts with Prettier.

  If the CLI helper tool gives you errors about this after upgrading, the
  solution is to change this:

  ```json
  {
    "rules": {
      "no-confusing-arrow": ["error"]
    }
  }
  ```

  Into this:

  ```json
  {
    "rules": {
      "no-confusing-arrow": ["error", { "allowParens": false }]
    }
  }
  ```

  The latter works in both ESLint 6 as well as in ESLint 5 and older.

- Improved: `eslint --print-config` usage instructions. The CLI tool help
  text as well as the documentation has been updated to suggest commands that
  work in ESLint 6.0 as well as in ESLint 5 and older. (Instead of `eslint
  --print-config .`, use `eslint --print-config path/to/main.js`.)

### Version 5.1.0 (2019-06-25)

- Added: [react/jsx-curly-newline]. Thanks to Masafumi Koba (@ybiquitous)!

### Version 5.0.0 (2019-06-15)

- Removed: [react/self-closing-comp]. This rule was added in v4.1.0 not
  because it _conflicted_ with Prettier but because it was _unnecessary_ when
  using Prettier. However, in v1.18.0 [Prettier stopped converting empty
  elements to self-closing elements][prettier-self-closing]. So the rule is
  not unnecessary anymore.

  If you use Prettier v1.17.1 or older you should be able to upgrade
  eslint-config-prettier to v5.0.0 without having to do anything else.

  If you use Prettier v1.18.0 or newer, you might get lint errors about for
  example changing `<div></div>` into `<div />`. You have two options:

  - Run `eslint --fix` if you prefer to enforce self-closing elements where
    possible. This should fix all the errors.
  - Add `"react/self-closing-comp": "off"` to your ESLint config if you use
    autofix from your editor and you face the same [issue as Prettier
    did][prettier-self-closing].

- Changed: Node.js 6 is no longer officially supported, but v5.0.0 should
  still work with it.

### Version 4.3.0 (2019-05-16)

- Added: New [eslint-plugin-vue] rules: [vue/arrow-spacing],
  [vue/block-spacing], [vue/brace-style] and [vue/comma-dangle].
- Added: New [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin] rules:
  [@typescript-eslint/func-call-spacing] and [@typescript-eslint/semi].

### Version 4.2.0 (2019-04-25)

- Added: [@typescript-eslint/no-extra-parens]. Thanks to Keiichiro Amemiya
  (@Hoishin) and Jen Gorfine (@jgorfine)!

### Version 4.1.0 (2019-02-26)

- Added: [linebreak-style]. Use Prettier’s [end-of-line] option instead.
- Added: [react/self-closing-comp]. Thanks to Gaurav Gupta (@gaurav5430)!

### Version 4.0.0 (2019-01-26)

- Breaking change: Support for [eslint-plugin-typescript] has been removed and
  replaced with support for its successor [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin].
  Thanks to TANIGUCHI Masaya (@ta2gch) and everyone else who helped with this!
- Changed: [arrow-body-style] and [prefer-arrow-callback] are now marked as
  [special rules][arrow-special], since they might cause problems if using
  [eslint-plugin-prettier] and `--fix`. They are turned off by default, and the
  CLI helper tool will _warn_ about them (but not error if you do enable them).
  This won’t break your linting checks, but do note that these rules will be
  disabled unless you explicitly enable them again, and that you might see new
  warnings when running the CLI helper tool.

### Version 3.6.0 (2019-01-19)

- Added: Support for [eslint-plugin-babel]. Thanks to Matija Marohnić
  (@silvenon)!

### Version 3.5.0 (2019-01-16)

- Fixed: The eslint-plugin-vue change from 3.4.0 has been reverted. That change
  requires eslint-plugin-vue@5, while many use eslint-plugin-vue@4. In other
  words, it was an accidental breaking change. Also, after thinking about it
  some more, it makes sense to have a Prettier-specific list of rules, rather
  than using the `vue/no-layout-rules` list, since there can be layout rules
  that don’t conflict with but rather complement Prettier.
- Added: New eslint-plugin-vue rules coming in the next version after 5.1.0.

### Version 3.4.0 (2019-01-13)

- Added: Support for [eslint-plugin-typescript]. Thanks to Jed Fox (@j-f1)!
- Improved: The eslint-plugin-vue integration is now using the
  `vue/no-layout-rules` config behind the scenes, so it should automatically
  stay up-to-date when new eslint-plugin-vue versions are released. Thanks to
  Michał Sajnóg (@michalsnik)!

### Version 3.3.0 (2018-11-11)

- Added: The [vue/html-self-closing] rule (as a [special
  rule][vue/html-self-closing-special]). Thanks to Yamagishi Kazutoshi (@ykzts)!

### Version 3.2.0 (2018-11-10)

- Added: Support for [eslint-plugin-vue].
- Fixed: The CLI helper tool should now work in Node.js 6 with npm 3 again.
  Thanks to Grant Snodgrass (@meeber)!
- Improved: Updated documentation.

### Version 3.1.0 (2018-09-22)

- Added: Support for [eslint-plugin-unicorn]. Thanks to John Mars (@j0hnm4r5)!
- Changed: The [quotes] rule is now allowed to be used to forbid unnecessary
  backticks. This means that the CLI helper tool no longer can automatically
  validate it, so you’ll need to refer the [quotes special rule
  documentation][quotes-special]. Thanks to Nick Petruzzelli (@npetruzzelli)!

### Version 3.0.1 (2018-08-13)

- Improved: `eslint --print-config` usage instructions.

### Version 3.0.0 (2018-08-13)

- Added: The [implicit-arrow-linebreak] rule.

### Version 2.8.0 (2017-11-19)

- Added: The [react/jsx-one-expression-per-line] rule.

### Version 2.7.0 (2017-11-01)

  rule][lines-around-comment-special]). Thanks to Maurice de Beijer
  (@mauricedb)!
- Added: The [no-unexpected-multiline] rule (as a [special
  rule][no-unexpected-multiline-special]). Thanks to Suhas Karanth
  (@sudo-suhas)!

- Added: The [no-floating-decimal] rule.

### Version 2.5.0 (2017-09-16)

- Added: Support for [eslint-plugin-standard]. Thanks to Christian Pekeler
  (@pekeler)!

### Version 2.4.0 (2017-09-02)

- Added: The [function-paren-newline] rule (new in [ESLint 4.6.0]). Thanks to
  Pierre Vanduynslager (@vanduynslagerp)!

### Version 2.3.0 (2017-06-30)

- Added: The (deprecated) [indent-legacy] rule. Thanks to M. Ian Graham
  (@miangraham)!

### Version 2.2.0 (2017-06-17)

- Added: New rules from [ESLint 4.0.0]:
  - [array-element-newline]

### Version 2.1.0 (2017-05-13)

- Added: The [no-tabs] rule (as a [special rule][no-tabs-special]). Thanks to
  Alex Meah (@AlexMeah)!

### Version 2.0.0 (2017-05-07)

- Changed/Improved: The CLI helper tool is now more helpful.

  - The options of special rules are now validated if possible. If a special
    rule is enabled with non-conflicting options, the CLI no longer warns about
    it.
  - If only special rules that cannot be automatically checked are found, the
    CLI no longer exists with a non-zero exit code. Instead, it only warns about
    the rules.

- Changed: The [no-confusing-arrow] is now a special rule again, since it might
  conflict with recent Prettier versions.

- Removed: The `react/wrap-multilines` rule (which has been deprecated for a
  while), since it was removed in eslint-plugin-react@7.

### Version 1.7.0 (2017-04-19)

- Changed: The [no-confusing-arrow] is no longer a special rule, but simply
  turned off, since recent Prettier versions make it redundant.
- Improved: The CLI helper tool now has a more helpful message for special
  rules, and exits with a different status code if only special rules were
  found. The exit codes are now documented as well.

### Version 1.6.0 (2017-04-05)

- Added: The [curly] rule. Thanks to Martin Rädlinger (@formatlos)!

### Version 1.5.0 (2017-03-04)

  This version updates all URLs to point to the new home of the project.

### Version 1.4.0 (2017-02-26)

- Added: The [no-confusing-arrow] rule (as a
  [special rule][no-confusing-arrow-special]). Thanks to Dominik Ferber
  (@dferber90)!
- Added: Deprecated or removed rules that might conflict with prettier. Thanks
  to Dominik Ferber (@dferber90)!

### Version 1.3.0 (2017-02-21)

- Added: The [template-tag-spacing] rule. Thanks to Thibault Derousseaux
  (@tibdex)!

### Version 1.2.0 (2017-02-14)

  (@0xR)!

- Improved: CLI helper tool instructions.

### Version 1.0.1 (2017-01-29)
