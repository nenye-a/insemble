/**
 * Creates a throttled function that only invokes `func` at most once per
 * every `wait` milliseconds. The throttled function comes with a `cancel`
 * method to cancel delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to
 * immediately invoke them. Provide `options` to indicate whether `func`
 * should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait`
 * timeout. The `func` is invoked with the last arguments provided to the
 * throttled function. Subsequent calls to the throttled function return the
 * result of the last `func` invocation.
 *
 * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is
 * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the throttled function
 * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.
 *
 * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred
 * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.
