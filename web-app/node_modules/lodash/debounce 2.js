/**
 * Creates a debounced function that delays invoking `func` until after `wait`
 * milliseconds have elapsed since the last time the debounced function was
 * invoked. The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel
 * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.
 * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the
 * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked
 * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent
 * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`
 * invocation.
 *
 * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is
 * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function
 * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.
 *
 * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred
 * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.
