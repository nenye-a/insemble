- **sourceFilename**: Correlate output AST nodes with their source filename.  Useful when generating code and source maps from the ASTs of multiple input files.

- **startLine**: By default, the first line of code parsed is treated as line 1. You can provide a line number to alternatively start with. Useful for integration with other source tools.

- **plugins**: Array containing the plugins that you want to enable.

- **strictMode**: TODO

### Output

Babylon generates AST according to [Babel AST format][].
It is based on [ESTree spec][] with the following deviations:

> There is now an `estree` plugin which reverts these deviations

- [Literal][] token is replaced with [StringLiteral][], [NumericLiteral][], [BooleanLiteral][], [NullLiteral][], [RegExpLiteral][]
- [Property][] token is replaced with [ObjectProperty][] and [ObjectMethod][]
- [MethodDefinition][] is replaced with [ClassMethod][]
- [Program][] and [BlockStatement][] contain additional `directives` field with [Directive][] and [DirectiveLiteral][]
- [ClassMethod][], [ObjectProperty][], and [ObjectMethod][] value property's properties in [FunctionExpression][] is coerced/brought into the main method node.

AST for JSX code is based on [Facebook JSX AST][] with the addition of one node type:

- `JSXText`

### Semver

Babylon follows semver in most situations. The only thing to note is that some spec-compliancy bug fixes may be released under patch versions.

For example: We push a fix to early error on something like [#107](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/107) - multiple default exports per file. That would be considered a bug fix even though it would cause a build to fail.

### Example

```javascript
require("babylon").parse("code", {
  // parse in strict mode and allow module declarations
  sourceType: "module",

  plugins: [
    // enable jsx and flow syntax
    "jsx",
    "flow"
  ]
});
```

### Plugins

 - `estree`
 - `jsx`
 - `flow`
 - `doExpressions`
 - `objectRestSpread`
 - `decorators` (Based on an outdated version of the Decorators proposal. Will be removed in a future version of `Babylon`)
 - `classProperties`
 - `exportExtensions`
 - `asyncGenerators`
 - `functionBind`
 - `functionSent`
 - `dynamicImport`
 - `templateInvalidEscapes`
