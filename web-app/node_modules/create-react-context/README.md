# create-react-context

> Polyfill for the [proposed React context API](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"ponyfills" the `React.createContext` API, not other
unrelated React 16+ APIs. If you are using a version of React <16, keep
in mind that you can only use features available in that version.

For example, you cannot pass children types aren't valid pre React 16:

```js
<Context.Provider>
  <div/>
  <div/>
</Context.Provider>
```

It will throw `A valid React element (or null) must be returned. You may have returned undefined, an array or some other invalid object.` because `<Context.Provider>` can only receive a single child element. To fix the error just wrap everyting in a single `<div>`:

```js
<Context.Provider>
  <div>
    <div/>
    <div/>
  </div>
</Context.Provider>
```
