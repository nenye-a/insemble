        " * @param {{ok:String}} userName",
        "*/"
    ].join('\n'), { unwrap: true });
```

This example returns the following AST:

    {
        "description": "This function comment is parsed by doctrine",
        "tags": [
            {
                "title": "param",
                "description": null,
                "type": {
                    "type": "RecordType",
                    "fields": [
                        {
                            "type": "FieldType",
                            "key": "<KEY>",
                            "value": {
                                "type": "NameExpression",
                                "name": "String"
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "name": "userName"
            }
        ]
    }
