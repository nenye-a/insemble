# Service Worker Precache

Service Worker Precache is a module for generating a service worker that
precaches resources. It integrates with your build process. Once configured, it
detects all your static resources (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) and
generates a hash of each file's contents. Information about each file's URL and
versioned hash are stored in the generated service worker file, along with logic
to serve those files cache-first, and automatically keep those files up to date
when changes are detected in subsequent builds.

Serving your local static resources cache-first means that you can get all the
crucial scaffolding for your web app—your App Shell—on the screen without having
to wait for any network responses.

The module can be used in JavaScript-based build scripts,
like those written with [`gulp`](http://gulpjs.com/), and it also provides a
[command-line interface](#command-line-interface). You can use the module
directly, or if you'd prefer, use one of the [wrappers](#wrappers-and-starter-kits)
around `sw-precache` for specific build environments, like
[`webpack`](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"Prefer Secure Origins For Powerful New Features" document](http://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features).

2. **Incorporate `sw-precache` into your `node`-based build script.** It should
work well with either `gulp` or `Grunt`, or other build scripts that run on
`node`. In fact, we've provided examples of both in the `demo/` directory. Each
build script in `demo` has a function called `writeServiceWorkerFile()` that
shows how to use the API. Both scripts generate fully-functional JavaScript code
that takes care of precaching and fetching all the resources your site needs to
function offline. There is also a [command-line interface](#command-line-interface)
available, for those using alternate build setups.

3. **Register the service worker JavaScript.** The JavaScript that's generated
needs to be registered as the controlling service worker for your pages. This
technically only needs to be done from within a top-level "entry" page for your
site, since the registration includes a [`scope`](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"License");
