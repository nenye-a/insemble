## 1.5.1

 - Q.any now annotates its error message to clarify that Q.any was involved and
   includes only the last error emitted. (Ivan Etchart)
 - Avoid domain.dispose during tests in preparation for Node.js 9. (Anna
   Henningsen)

## 1.5.0

 - Q.any gives an error message from the last rejected promise
 - Throw if callback supplied to "finally" is invalid (@grahamrhay)
 - Long stack trace improvements, can now construct long stack traces
   across rethrows.

## 1.4.1

 - Address an issue that prevented Q from being used as a `<script>` for
   Firefox add-ons. Q can now be used in any environment that provides `window`
   or `self` globals, favoring `window` since add-ons have an an immutable
   `self` that is distinct from `window`.

## 1.4.0

 - Add `noConflict` support for use in `<script>` (@jahnjw).

## 1.3.0

 - Add tracking for unhandled and handled rejections in Node.js (@benjamingr).

## 1.2.1

 - Fix Node.js environment detection for modern Browserify (@kahnjw).

## 1.2.0

 - Added Q.any(promisesArray) method (@vergara).
   Returns a promise fulfilled with the value of the first resolved promise in
   promisesArray. If all promises in promisesArray are rejected, it returns
   a rejected promise.

## 1.1.2

 - Removed extraneous files from the npm package by using the "files"
   whitelist in package.json instead of the .npmignore blacklist.
   (@anton-rudeshko)

## 1.1.1

 - Fix a pair of regressions in bootstrapping, one which precluded
   WebWorker support, and another that precluded support in
   ``<script>`` usage outright. #607

## 1.1.0

 - Adds support for enabling long stack traces in node.js by setting
   environment variable `Q_DEBUG=1`.
 - Introduces the `tap` method to promises, which will see a value
   pass through without alteration.
 - Use instanceof to recognize own promise instances as opposed to
   thenables.
 - Construct timeout errors with `code === ETIMEDOUT` (Kornel Lesiński)
 - More descriminant CommonJS module environment detection.
 - Dropped continuous integration for Node.js 0.6 and 0.8 because of
   changes to npm that preclude the use of new `^` version predicate
   operator in any transitive dependency.
 - Users can now override `Q.nextTick`.

## 1.0.1

 - Adds support for `Q.Promise`, which implements common usage of the
   ES6 `Promise` constructor and its methods. `Promise` does not have
   a valid promise constructor and a proper implementation awaits
   version 2 of Q.
 - Removes the console stopgap for a promise inspector. This no longer
   works with any degree of reliability.
 - Fixes support for content security policies that forbid eval. Now
   using the `StopIteration` global to distinguish SpiderMonkey
   generators from ES6 generators, assuming that they will never
   coexist.

## 1.0.0

:cake: This is all but a re-release of version 0.9, which has settled
into a gentle maintenance mode and rightly deserves an official 1.0.
An ambitious 2.0 release is already around the corner, but 0.9/1.0
have been distributed far and wide and demand long term support.

 - Q will now attempt to post a debug message in browsers regardless
   of whether window.Touch is defined. Chrome at least now has this
   property regardless of whether touch is supported by the underlying
   hardware.
 - Remove deprecation warning from `promise.valueOf`. The function is
   called by the browser in various ways so there is no way to
   distinguish usage that should be migrated from usage that cannot be
   altered.

## 0.9.7

 - :warning: `q.min.js` is no longer checked-in.  It is however still
   created by Grunt and NPM.
 - Fixes a bug that inhibited `Q.async` with implementations of the new
   ES6 generators.
 - Fixes a bug with `nextTick` affecting Safari 6.0.5 the first time a
   page loads when an `iframe` is involved.
 - Introduces `passByCopy`, `join`, and `race`.
 - Shows stack traces or error messages on the console, instead of
   `Error` objects.
 - Elimintates wrapper methods for improved performance.
 - `Q.all` now propagates progress notifications of the form you might
   expect of ES6 iterations, `{value, index}` where the `value` is the
   progress notification from the promise at `index`.

## 0.9.6

 - Fixes a bug in recognizing the difference between compatible Q
   promises, and Q promises from before the implementation of "inspect".
   The latter are now coerced.
 - Fixes an infinite asynchronous coercion cycle introduced by former
   solution, in two independently sufficient ways.  1.) All promises
   returned by makePromise now implement "inspect", albeit a default
   that reports that the promise has an "unknown" state.  2.) The
   implementation of "then/when" is now in "then" instead of "when", so
   that the responsibility to "coerce" the given promise rests solely in
   the "when" method and the "then" method may assume that "this" is a
   promise of the right type.
 - Refactors `nextTick` to use an unrolled microtask within Q regardless
   of how new ticks a requested. #316 @rkatic

## 0.9.5

 - Introduces `inspect` for getting the state of a promise as
   `{state: "fulfilled" | "rejected" | "pending", value | reason}`.
 - Introduces `allSettled` which produces an array of promises states
   for the input promises once they have all "settled".  This is in
   accordance with a discussion on Promises/A+ that "settled" refers to
   a promise that is "fulfilled" or "rejected".  "resolved" refers to a
   deferred promise that has been "resolved" to another promise,
   "sealing its fate" to the fate of the successor promise.
 - Long stack traces are now off by default.  Set `Q.longStackSupport`
   to true to enable long stack traces.
 - Long stack traces can now follow the entire asynchronous history of a
   promise, not just a single jump.
 - Introduces `spawn` for an immediately invoked asychronous generator.
   @jlongster
 - Support for *experimental* synonyms `mapply`, `mcall`, `nmapply`,
   `nmcall` for method invocation.

## 0.9.4

 - `isPromise` and `isPromiseAlike` now always returns a boolean
   (even for falsy values). #284 @lfac-pt
 - Support for ES6 Generators in `async` #288 @andywingo
 - Clear duplicate promise rejections from dispatch methods #238 @SLaks
 - Unhandled rejection API #296 @domenic
   `stopUnhandledRejectionTracking`, `getUnhandledReasons`,
   `resetUnhandledRejections`.

## 0.9.3

 - Add the ability to give `Q.timeout`'s errors a custom error message. #270
   @jgrenon
 - Fix Q's call-stack busting behavior in Node.js 0.10, by switching from
   `process.nextTick` to `setImmediate`. #254 #259
 - Fix Q's behavior when used with the Mocha test runner in the browser, since
   Mocha introduces a fake `process` global without a `nextTick` property. #267
 - Fix some, but not all, cases wherein Q would give false positives in its
   unhandled rejection detection (#252). A fix for other cases (#238) is
   hopefully coming soon.
 - Made `Q.promise` throw early if given a non-function.

## 0.9.2

 - Pass through progress notifications when using `timeout`. #229 @omares
 - Pass through progress notifications when using `delay`.
 - Fix `nbind` to actually bind the `thisArg`. #232 @davidpadbury

## 0.9.1

 - Made the AMD detection compatible with the RequireJS optimizer's `namespace`
   option. #225 @terinjokes
 - Fix side effects from `valueOf`, and thus from `isFulfilled`, `isRejected`,
   and `isPending`. #226 @benjamn

## 0.9.0

This release removes many layers of deprecated methods and brings Q closer to
alignment with Mark Miller’s TC39 [strawman][] for concurrency. At the same
time, it fixes many bugs and adds a few features around error handling. Finally,
it comes with an updated and comprehensive [API Reference][].

[strawman]: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:concurrency
[API Reference]: DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"exception" property.  If an object
   isRejected(object), then object.valueOf().exception will
   be the wrapped error.
 - Added Jasmine specifications
 - Support Internet Explorers 7–9 (with multiple bug fixes @domenic)
 - Support Firefox 12
 - Support Safari 5.1.5
 - Support Chrome 18

## 0.8.4

 - WARNING: ``promise.timeout`` is now rejected with an ``Error`` object
   and the message now includes the duration of the timeout in
   miliseconds.  This doesn't constitute (in my opinion) a
   backward-incompatibility since it is a change of an undocumented and
   unspecified public behavior, but if you happened to depend on the
   exception being a string, you will need to revise your code.
 - Added ``deferred.makeNodeResolver()`` to replace the more cryptic
   ``deferred.node()`` method.
 - Added experimental ``Q.promise(maker(resolve, reject))`` to make a
   promise inside a callback, such that thrown exceptions in the
   callback are converted and the resolver and rejecter are arguments.
   This is a shorthand for making a deferred directly and inspired by
   @gozala’s stream constructor pattern and the Microsoft Windows Metro
   Promise constructor interface.
 - Added experimental ``Q.begin()`` that is intended to kick off chains
   of ``.then`` so that each of these can be reordered without having to
   edit the new and former first step.

## 0.8.3

 - Added ``isFulfilled``, ``isRejected``, and ``isResolved``
   to the promise prototype.
 - Added ``allResolved`` for waiting for every promise to either be
   fulfilled or rejected, without propagating an error. @utvara #53
 - Added ``Q.bind`` as a method to transform functions that
   return and throw into promise-returning functions. See
   [an example](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"q" module now exports its ``ref`` function as a "Q"
   constructor, with module systems that support exports
   assignment including NodeJS, RequireJS, and when used as
   a ``<script>`` tag. Notably, strictly compliant CommonJS
   does not support this, but UncommonJS does.
 - Added ``async`` decorator for generators that use yield
   to "trampoline" promises. In engines that support
   generators (SpiderMonkey), this will greatly reduce the
   need for nested callbacks.
 - Made ``when`` chainable.
 - Made ``all`` chainable.

## 0.5.3

 - Added ``all`` and refactored ``join`` and ``wait`` to use
   it.  All of these will now reject at the earliest
   rejection.

## 0.5.2

 - Minor improvement to ``spy``; now waits for resolution of
   callback promise.

## 0.5.1

 - Made most Q API methods chainable on promise objects, and
   turned the previous promise-methods of ``join``,
   ``wait``, and ``report`` into Q API methods.
 - Added ``apply`` and ``call`` to the Q API, and ``apply``
   as a promise handler.
 - Added ``fail``, ``fin``, and ``spy`` to Q and the promise
   prototype for convenience when observing rejection,
   fulfillment and rejection, or just observing without
   affecting the resolution.
 - Renamed ``def`` (although ``def`` remains shimmed until
   the next major release) to ``master``.
 - Switched to using ``MessageChannel`` for next tick task
   enqueue in browsers that support it.

## 0.5.0 - MINOR BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY

 - Exceptions are no longer reported when consumed.
 - Removed ``error`` from the API.  Since exceptions are
   getting consumed, throwing them in an errback causes the
   exception to silently disappear.  Use ``end``.
 - Added ``end`` as both an API method and a promise-chain
   ending method.  It causes propagated rejections to be
   thrown, which allows Node to write stack traces and
   emit ``uncaughtException`` events, and browsers to
   likewise emit ``onerror`` and log to the console.
 - Added ``join`` and ``wait`` as promise chain functions,
   so you can wait for variadic promises, returning your own
   promise back, or join variadic promises, resolving with a
   callback that receives variadic fulfillment values.

## 0.4.4

 - ``end`` no longer returns a promise. It is the end of the
   promise chain.
 - Stopped reporting thrown exceptions in ``when`` callbacks
   and errbacks.  These must be explicitly reported through
   ``.end()``, ``.then(null, Q.error)``, or some other
   mechanism.
 - Added ``report`` as an API method, which can be used as
   an errback to report and propagate an error.
 - Added ``report`` as a promise-chain method, so an error
   can be reported if it passes such a gate.

## 0.4.3

 - Fixed ``<script>`` support that regressed with 0.4.2
   because of "use strict" in the module system
   multi-plexer.

## 0.4.2

 - Added support for RequireJS (jburke)

## 0.4.1

 - Added an "end" method to the promise prototype,
   as a shorthand for waiting for the promise to
   be resolved gracefully, and failing to do so,
   to dump an error message.

## 0.4.0 - BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE*

 - *Removed the utility modules. NPM and Node no longer
   expose any module except the main module.  These have
   been moved and merged into the "qq" package.
 - *In a non-CommonJS browser, q.js can be used as a script.
   It now creates a Q global variable.
 - Fixed thenable assimilation.
 - Fixed some issues with asap, when it resolves to
   undefined, or throws an exception.

## 0.3.0 - BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE

 - The `post` method has been reverted to its original
   signature, as provided in Tyler Close's `ref_send` API.
   That is, `post` accepts two arguments, the second of
   which is an arbitrary object, but usually invocation
   arguments as an `Array`.  To provide variadic arguments
   to `post`, there is a new `invoke` function that posts
   the variadic arguments to the value given in the first
   argument.
 - The `defined` method has been moved from `q` to `q/util`
   since it gets no use in practice but is still
   theoretically useful.
 - The `Promise` constructor has been renamed to
   `makePromise` to be consistent with the convention that
   functions that do not require the `new` keyword to be
   used as constructors have camelCase names.
 - The `isResolved` function has been renamed to
   `isFulfilled`.  There is a new `isResolved` function that
   indicates whether a value is not a promise or, if it is a
   promise, whether it has been either fulfilled or
   rejected.  The code has been revised to reflect this
   nuance in terminology.

## 0.2.10

 - Added `join` to `"q/util"` for variadically joining
   multiple promises.

## 0.2.9

 - The future-compatible `invoke` method has been added,
   to replace `post`, since `post` will become backward-
   incompatible in the next major release.
 - Exceptions thrown in the callbacks of a `when` call are
   now emitted to Node's `"uncaughtException"` `process`
   event in addition to being returned as a rejection reason.

## 0.2.8

 - Exceptions thrown in the callbacks of a `when` call
   are now consumed, warned, and transformed into
   rejections of the promise returned by `when`.

## 0.2.7

 - Fixed a minor bug in thenable assimilation, regressed
   because of the change in the forwarding protocol.
 - Fixed behavior of "q/util" `deep` method on dates and
   other primitives. Github issue #11.

## 0.2.6

 - Thenables (objects with a "then" method) are accepted
   and provided, bringing this implementation of Q
   into conformance with Promises/A, B, and D.
 - Added `makePromise`, to replace the `Promise` function
   eventually.
 - Rejections are now also duck-typed. A rejection is a
   promise with a valueOf method that returns a rejection
   descriptor. A rejection descriptor has a
   "promiseRejected" property equal to "true" and a
   "reason" property corresponding to the rejection reason.
 - Altered the `makePromise` API such that the `fallback`
   method no longer receives a superfluous `resolved` method
   after the `operator`.  The fallback method is responsible
   only for returning a resolution.  This breaks an
   undocumented API, so third-party API's depending on the
   previous undocumented behavior may break.

## 0.2.5

 - Changed promises into a duck-type such that multiple
   instances of the Q module can exchange promise objects.
   A promise is now defined as "an object that implements the
   `promiseSend(op, resolved, ...)` method and `valueOf`".
 - Exceptions in promises are now captured and returned
   as rejections.

## 0.2.4

 - Fixed bug in `ref` that prevented `del` messages from
   being received (gozala)
 - Fixed a conflict with FireFox 4; constructor property
   is now read-only.

## 0.2.3

 - Added `keys` message to promises and to the promise API.

## 0.2.2

 - Added boilerplate to `q/queue` and `q/util`.
 - Fixed missing dependency to `q/queue`.

## 0.2.1

 - The `resolve` and `reject` methods of `defer` objects now
   return the resolution promise for convenience.
 - Added `q/util`, which provides `step`, `delay`, `shallow`,
   `deep`, and three reduction orders.
 - Added `q/queue` module for a promise `Queue`.
 - Added `q-comm` to the list of compatible libraries.
 - Deprecated `defined` from `q`, with intent to move it to
   `q/util`.

## 0.2.0 - BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE

 - Changed post(ref, name, args) to variadic
   post(ref, name, ...args). BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE
 - Added a def(value) method to annotate an object as being
   necessarily a local value that cannot be serialized, such
   that inter-process/worker/vat promise communication
   libraries will send messages to it, but never send it
   back.
 - Added a send(value, op, ...args) method to the public API, for
   forwarding messages to a value or promise in a future turn.

## 0.1.9

 - Added isRejected() for testing whether a value is a rejected
   promise.  isResolved() retains the behavior of stating
   that rejected promises are not resolved.

## 0.1.8

 - Fixed isResolved(null) and isResolved(undefined) [issue #9]
 - Fixed a problem with the Object.create shim

## 0.1.7

 - shimmed ES5 Object.create in addition to Object.freeze
   for compatibility on non-ES5 engines (gozala)

## 0.1.6

 - Q.isResolved added
 - promise.valueOf() now returns the value of resolved
   and near values
 - asap retried
 - promises are frozen when possible

## 0.1.5

 - fixed dependency list for Teleport (gozala)
 - all unit tests now pass (gozala)

## 0.1.4

 - added support for Teleport as an engine (gozala)
 - simplified and updated methods for getting internal
   print and enqueue functions universally (gozala)

## 0.1.3

 - fixed erroneous link to the q module in package.json

## 0.1.2

 - restructured for overlay style package compatibility

## 0.1.0

 - removed asap because it was broken, probably down to the
   philosophy.

## 0.0.3

 - removed q-util
 - fixed asap so it returns a value if completed

## 0.0.2

 - added q-util

## 0.0.1

 - initial version
