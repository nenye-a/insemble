### Usage with Bundlers

If you're using a bundler like [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org) (with [`style-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader)/[`css-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader)) or [`parcel`](https://parceljs.org), you can [install `shards` with `npm`](#getting-started) and import it:

```javascript
// app.js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
import 'shards-ui/dist/css/shards.min.css';
// Optional JavaScript
// JavaScript Dependencies: jQuery, Popper.js, Bootstrap JS, Shards JS
// Install them with `npm` as well
import 'jquery/dist/jquery.slim.min';
import 'popper.js/dist/umd/popper.min';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min';
import 'shards-ui/dist/js/shards.min';
```
