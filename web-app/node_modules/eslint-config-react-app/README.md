# eslint-config-react-app

This package includes the shareable ESLint configuration used by [Create React App](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"extends": ["react-app", "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended"],
  "plugins": ["jsx-a11y"]
}
```

However, if you are using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and have not ejected, any additional rules will only be displayed in the [IDE integrations](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/setting-up-your-editor#displaying-lint-output-in-the-editor), but not in the browser or the terminal.
