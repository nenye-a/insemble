# v2.6.3
- Updated lodash to squelch a security warning (#1675)

# v2.6.2
- Updated lodash to squelch a security warning (#1620)

# v2.6.1
- Updated lodash to prevent `npm audit` warnings. (#1532, #1533)
- Made `async-es` more optimized for webpack users (#1517)
- Fixed a stack overflow with large collections and a synchronous iterator (#1514)
- Various small fixes/chores (#1505, #1511, #1527, #1530)

# v2.6.0
- Added missing aliases for many methods.  Previously, you could not (e.g.) `require('async/find')` or use `async.anyLimit`. (#1483)
- Improved `queue` performance. (#1448, #1454)
- Add missing sourcemap (#1452, #1453)
- Various doc updates (#1448, #1471, #1483)

# v2.5.0
- Added `concatLimit`, the `Limit` equivalent of [`concat`](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"async/series")` to only require the `series` function. Every Async library function is available this way. You still can `require("async")` to require the entire library, like you could do before.

We also provide Async as a collection of ES2015 modules. You can now `import {each} from 'async-es'` or `import waterfall from 'async-es/waterfall'`. If you are using only a few Async functions, and are using a ES bundler such as Rollup, this can significantly lower your build size.

Major thanks to [**@Kikobeats**](github.com/Kikobeats), [**@aearly**](github.com/aearly) and [**@megawac**](github.com/megawac) for doing the majority of the modularization work, as well as [**@jdalton**](github.com/jdalton) and [**@Rich-Harris**](github.com/Rich-Harris) for advisory work on the general modularization strategy.

Another one of the general themes of the 2.0 release is standardization of what an "async" function is. We are now more strictly following the node-style continuation passing style. That is, an async function is a function that:

1. Takes a variable number of arguments
2. The last argument is always a callback
3. The callback can accept any number of arguments
4. The first argument passed to the callback will be treated as an error result, if the argument is truthy
5. Any number of result arguments can be passed after the "error" argument
6. The callback is called once and exactly once, either on the same tick or later tick of the JavaScript event loop.

There were several cases where Async accepted some functions that did not strictly have these properties, most notably `auto`, `every`, `some`, `filter`, `reject` and `detect`.

Another theme is performance. We have eliminated internal deferrals in all cases where they make sense. For example, in `waterfall` and `auto`, there was a `setImmediate` between each task -- these deferrals have been removed. A `setImmediate` call can add up to 1ms of delay. This might not seem like a lot, but it can add up if you are using many Async functions in the course of processing a HTTP request, for example. Nearly all asynchronous functions that do I/O already have some sort of deferral built in, so the extra deferral is unnecessary. The trade-off of this change is removing our built-in stack-overflow defense. Many synchronous callback calls in series can quickly overflow the JS call stack. If you do have a function that is sometimes synchronous (calling its callback on the same tick), and are running into stack overflows, wrap it with `async.ensureAsync()`.

Another big performance win has been re-implementing `queue`, `cargo`, and `priorityQueue` with [doubly linked lists](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"constructor"` as an argument in `memoize` ([#998](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/998))
- Give a better error messsage when `auto` dependency checking fails ([#994](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/994))
- Various doc updates ([#936](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/936), [#956](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/956), [#979](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/979), [#1002](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1002))

- `retry` now accepts an `interval` parameter to specify a delay between retries. ([#793](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/793))

# v1.2.1

Bug Fix:

- Small regression with synchronous iterator behavior in `eachSeries` with a 1-element array. Before 1.1.0, `eachSeries`'s callback was called on the same tick, which this patch restores. In 2.0.0, it will be called on the next tick. ([#782](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/782))


# v1.2.0

New Features:

- Added `timesLimit` ([#743](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/743))
- `concurrency` can be changed after initialization in `queue` by setting `q.concurrency`. The new concurrency will be reflected the next time a task is processed. ([#747](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/747), [#772](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/772))

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a regression in `each` and family with empty arrays that have additional properties. ([#775](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/775), [#777](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/777))


# v1.1.1

Bug Fix:

- Small regression with synchronous iterator behavior in `eachSeries` with a 1-element array. Before 1.1.0, `eachSeries`'s callback was called on the same tick, which this patch restores. In 2.0.0, it will be called on the next tick. ([#782](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/782))


# v1.1.0

New Features:

- Optimized `map`, `eachOf`, and `waterfall` families of functions
- Passing a `null` or `undefined` array to `map`, `each`, `parallel` and families will be treated as an empty array ([#667](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/667)).
- The callback is now optional for the composed results of `compose` and `seq`. ([#618](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/618))
- Reduced file size by 4kb, (minified version by 1kb)

- `each` and family will properly handle an empty array ([#578](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/578))
- `eachSeries` and family will finish if the underlying array is modified during execution ([#557](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/557))
- `queue` will throw if a non-function is passed to `q.push()` ([#593](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/593))
- Doc fixes ([#629](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/629), [#766](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/766))
