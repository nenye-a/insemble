	GYP source file spec for Xcode 3

	There is not much documentation available regarding the format
	of .pbfilespec files. As a starting point, see for instance the
	outdated documentation at:
	http://maxao.free.fr/xcode-plugin-interface/specifications.html
	and the files in:
	DELETED_BASE64_STRING.framework/Versions/A/Resources/

	Place this file in directory:
	~/Library/Application DELETED_BASE64_STRING
