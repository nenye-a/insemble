7.0.0 / 2018-07-16
------------------

- **BREAKING:** Refine `copy*()` handling of symlinks to properly detect symlinks that point to the same file. ([#582](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"ncp": "^0.6.0"` to `"ncp": "^1.0.1"`
- imported `mkdirp` => `minimist` and `mkdirp` are no longer dependences, should now appease people who wanted `mkdirp` to be `--use_strict` safe. See [#59]([#59][#59])

0.12.0 / 2014-09-22
-------------------
- copy symlinks in `copySync()` [#85][#85]

0.11.1 / 2014-09-02
-------------------
- bugfix `copySync()` preserve file permissions [#80][#80]

0.11.0 / 2014-08-11
-------------------
- upgraded `"ncp": "^0.5.1"` to `"ncp": "^0.6.0"`
- upgrade `jsonfile": "^1.2.0"` to `jsonfile": "^2.0.0"` => on write, json files now have `\n` at end. Also adds `options.throws` to `readJsonSync()`
