### v2.7.4

* Reset colors prior to ending a line, to eliminate flicker when a line
  is trucated between start and end color sequences.

### v2.7.3

* Only create our onExit handler when we're enabled and remove it when we're
  disabled.  This stops us from creating multiple onExit handlers when
  multiple gauge objects are being used.
* Fix bug where if a theme name were given instead of a theme object, it
  would crash.
* Remove supports-color because it's not actually used.  Uhm.  Yes, I just
  updated it.  >.>

### v2.7.2

* Use supports-color instead of has-color (as the module has been renamed)

### v2.7.1

* Bug fix: Calls to show/pulse while the progress bar is disabled should still
  update our internal representation of what would be shown should it be enabled.

### v2.7.0

* New feature: Add new `isEnabled` method to allow introspection of the gauge's
  "enabledness" as controlled by `.enable()` and `.disable()`.

### v2.6.0

* Bug fix: Don't run the code associated with `enable`/`disable` if the gauge
  is already enabled or disabled respectively.  This prevents leaking event
  listeners, amongst other weirdness.
* New feature: Template items can have default values that will be used if no
  value was otherwise passed in.

### v2.5.3

* Default to `enabled` only if we have a tty.  Users can always override
  this by passing in the `enabled` option explicitly or by calling calling
  `gauge.enable()`.

### v2.5.2

* Externalized `./console-strings.js` into `console-control-strings`.

### v2.5.1

* Update to `signal-exit@3.0.0`, which fixes a compatibility bug with the
  node profiler.
