# Release Notes

## Development

[Commits](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"Handlebars.VM.resolvePartial ([@AndrewLeedham](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"browser"-property should not break anything, but you can never be sure. The integration test for webpack 
  shows that it works, but if it doesn't please open an issue.

Compatibility notes:

Access to the constructor of a class thought `{{lookup obj "constructor" }}` is now prohibited. This closes 
a leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.

This kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described
in #1495. We will **not** increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented, 
and because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version
and the issue may not be resolved on many systems).
