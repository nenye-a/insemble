    jsdom
</h1>

jsdom is a pure-JavaScript implementation of many web standards, notably the WHATWG [DOM](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"ready to roll!");
};
```

```html
<!-- Inside the HTML you supply to jsdom -->
<script>
requirejs(["entry-module"], () => {
  window.onModulesLoaded();
});
</script>
```

If you do not control the page, you could try workarounds such as polling for the presence of a specific element.

For more details, see the discussion in [#640](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"blah";
console.log(dom2.window.document.createElement("frameset").expando); // logs "blah"
```

This is done mainly for performance and memory reasons: creating separate copies of all the many classes on the web platform, each time we create a jsdom, would be rather expensive.

Nevertheless, we remain interested in one day providing an option to create an "independent" jsdom, at the cost of some performance.

### Unimplemented parts of the web platform

Although we enjoy adding new features to jsdom and keeping it up to date with the latest web specs, it has many missing APIs. Please feel free to file an issue for anything missing, but we're a small and busy team, so a pull request might work even better.

Beyond just features that we haven't gotten to yet, there are two major features that are currently outside the scope of jsdom. These are:

- **Navigation**: the ability to change the global object, and all other objects, when clicking a link or assigning `location.href` or similar.
- **Layout**: the ability to calculate where elements will be visually laid out as a result of CSS, which impacts methods like `getBoundingClientRects()` or properties like `offsetTop`.

Currently jsdom has dummy behaviors for some aspects of these features, such as sending a "not implemented" `"jsdomError"` to the virtual console for navigation, or returning zeros for many layout-related properties. Often you can work around these limitations in your code, e.g. by creating new `JSDOM` instances for each page you "navigate" to during a crawl, or using `Object.defineProperty()` to change what various layout-related getters and methods return.

Note that other tools in the same space, such as PhantomJS, do support these features. On the wiki, we have a more complete writeup about [jsdom vs. PhantomJS](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/wiki/jsdom-vs.-PhantomJS).

## Supporting jsdom

jsdom is a community-driven project maintained by a team of [volunteers](https://github.com/orgs/jsdom/people). You could support jsdom by:
