## Node.js

To install:

```sh
yarn add es6-promise
```

or

```sh
npm install es6-promise
```

To use:

```js
var Promise = require('es6-promise').Promise;
```


## Usage in IE<9

`catch` and `finally` are reserved keywords in IE<9, meaning
`promise.catch(func)` or `promise.finally(func)` throw a syntax error. To work
around this, you can use a string to access the property as shown in the
following example.

However most minifiers will automatically fix this for you, making the
resulting code safe for old browsers and production:

```js
promise['catch'](function(err) {
  // ...
});
```

```js
promise['finally'](function() {
  // ...
});
```

## Auto-polyfill

To polyfill the global environment (either in Node or in the browser via CommonJS) use the following code snippet:

```js
require('es6-promise').polyfill();
```

Alternatively

```js
require('es6-promise/auto');
```

Notice that we don't assign the result of `polyfill()` to any variable. The `polyfill()` method will patch the global environment (in this case to the `Promise` name) when called.

## Building & Testing

You will need to have PhantomJS installed globally in order to run the tests.

`npm install -g phantomjs`

* `npm run build` to build
* `npm test` to run tests
* `npm start` to run a build watcher, and webserver to test
* `npm run test:server` for a testem test runner and watching builder
