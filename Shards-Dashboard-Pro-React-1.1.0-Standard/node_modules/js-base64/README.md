Which is a Base64-encoded 1x1 transparent PNG, **DO NOT USE** `Base64.decode(pngBase64)`.  Use `Base64.atob(pngBase64)` instead.  `Base64.decode()` decodes to UTF-8 string while `Base64.atob()` decodes to bytes, which is compatible to browser built-in `atob()` (Which is absent in node.js).  The same rule applies to the opposite direction.
