## Community

Join the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/json5) if you’re
interested in JSON5 news, updates, and general discussion.
Don’t worry, it’s very low-traffic.

The [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/wiki) is a good place to track
JSON5 support and usage. Contribute freely there!

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues) is the place to
formally propose feature requests and report bugs. Questions and general
feedback are better directed at the Google Group.


## Usage

This JavaScript implementation of JSON5 simply provides a `JSON5` object just
like the native ES5 `JSON` object.

To use from Node:

```sh
npm install json5
```

```js
var JSON5 = require('json5');
```

To use in the browser (adds the `JSON5` object to the global namespace):

```html
<script src="json5.js"></script>
```

Then in both cases, you can simply replace native `JSON` calls with `JSON5`:

```js
var obj = JSON5.parse('{unquoted:"key",trailing:"comma",}');
var str = JSON5.stringify(obj);
```

`JSON5.parse` supports all of the JSON5 features listed above (*TODO: except
Unicode*), as well as the native [`reviver` argument][json-parse].

`JSON5.stringify` mainly avoids quoting keys where possible, but we hope to
keep expanding it in the future (e.g. to also output trailing commas).
It supports the native [`replacer` and `space` arguments][json-stringify],
as well. *(TODO: Any implemented `toJSON` methods aren’t used today.)*

### Extras

If you’re running this on Node, you can also register a JSON5 `require()` hook
to let you `require()` `.json5` files just like you can `.json` files:

```js
require('json5/lib/require');
require('./path/to/foo');   // tries foo.json5 after foo.js, foo.json, etc.
require('./path/to/bar.json5');
```

This module also provides a `json5` executable (requires Node) for converting
JSON5 files to JSON:

```sh
json5 -c path/to/foo.json5    # generates path/to/foo.json
```


## Development

```sh
git clone git://github.com/aseemk/json5.git
cd json5
npm install
npm test
```

As the `package.json5` file states, be sure to run `npm run build` on changes
to `package.json5`, since npm requires `package.json`.

Feel free to [file issues](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues) and submit
[pull requests](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/pulls) — contributions are
welcome. If you do submit a pull request, please be sure to add or update the
tests, and ensure that `npm test` continues to pass.

## Credits

[Michael Bolin](http://bolinfest.com/) independently arrived at and published
some of these same ideas with awesome explanations and detail.

[Suggested Improvements to JSON](http://bolinfest.com/essays/json.html)

[Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/) of course designed and built
JSON, but his state machine diagrams on the [JSON website](http://json.org/),
as cheesy as it may sound, gave me motivation and confidence that building a
new parser to implement these ideas this was within my reach!
This code is also modeled directly off of Doug’s open-source [json_parse.js][]
parser. I’m super grateful for that clean and well-documented code.

[Max Nanasy](https://github.com/MaxNanasy) has been an early and prolific
supporter, contributing multiple patches and ideas. Thanks Max!

[Andrew Eisenberg](https://github.com/aeisenberg) has contributed the
`stringify` method.

[Jordan Tucker](https://github.com/jordanbtucker) has aligned JSON5 more closely
with ES5 and is actively maintaining this project.
