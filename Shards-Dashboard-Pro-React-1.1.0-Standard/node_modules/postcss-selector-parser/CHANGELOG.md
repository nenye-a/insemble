  selector with pseudos, and tokens after combinators.

# 5.0.0-rc.1

To ease adoption of the v5.0 release, we have relaxed the node version
check performed by npm at installation time to allow for node 4, which
remains officially unsupported, but likely to continue working for the
time being.

# 5.0.0-rc.0

This release has **BREAKING CHANGES** that were required to fix regressions
in 4.0.0 and to make the Combinator Node API consistent for all combinator
types. Please read carefully.

## Summary of Changes

* The way a descendent combinator that isn't a single space character (E.g. `.a  .b`) is stored in the AST has changed.
* Named Combinators (E.g. `.a /for/ .b`) are now properly parsed as a combinator.
* It is now possible to look up a node based on the source location of a character in that node and to query nodes if they contain some character.
* Several bug fixes that caused the parser to hang and run out of memory when a `/` was encountered have been fixed.
* The minimum supported version of Node is now `v6.0.0`.

### Changes to the Descendent Combinator

In prior releases, the value of a descendant combinator with multiple spaces included all the spaces.

* `.a   .b`: Extra spaces are now stored as space before.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `combinator.value === "   "`
  - New hotness:
    - `combinator.value === " " && combinator.spaces.before === "  "`
* `.a   /*comment*/.b`: A comment at the end of the combinator causes extra space to become after space.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `combinator.value === "   "`
    - `combinator.raws.value === "   /*comment/"`
  - New hotness:
    - `combinator.value === " "`
    - `combinator.spaces.after === "  "`
    - `combinator.raws.spaces.after === "  /*comment*/"`
* `.a<newline>.b`: whitespace that doesn't start or end with a single space character is stored as a raw value.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `combinator.value === "\n"`
    - `combinator.raws.value === undefined`
  - New hotness:
    - `combinator.value === " "`
    - `combinator.raws.value === "\n"`

### Support for "Named Combinators"

Although, nonstandard and unlikely to ever become a standard, combinators like `/deep/` and `/for/` are now properly supported.

Because they've been taken off the standardization track, there is no spec-official name for combinators of the form `/<ident>/`. However, I talked to [Tab Atkins](DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS"foo=bar"]`) (thanks to @montmanu).
* Adds `quoted` and `raw.unquoted` properties to attribute nodes
  (thanks to @davidtheclark).

# 1.3.3

* Fixes an infinite loop on `)` and `]` tokens when they had no opening pairs.
  Now postcss-selector-parser will throw when it encounters these lone tokens.

#Â 1.3.2

* Now uses plain integers rather than `str.charCodeAt(0)` for compiled builds.

# 1.3.1

* Update flatten to v1.x (thanks to @shinnn).

# 1.3.0

* Adds a new node type, `String`, to fix a crash on selectors such as
  `foo:bar("test")`.

# 1.2.1

* Fixes a crash when the parser encountered a trailing combinator.

# 1.2.0

* A more descriptive error is thrown when the parser expects to find a
  pseudo-class/pseudo-element (thanks to @ashelley).
* Adds support for line/column locations for selector nodes, as well as a
  `Node#sourceIndex` method (thanks to @davidtheclark).

# 1.1.4

* Fixes a crash when a selector started with a `>` combinator. The module will
  now no longer throw if a selector has a leading/trailing combinator node.

# 1.1.3

* Fixes a crash on `@` tokens.

# 1.1.2

* Fixes an infinite loop caused by using parentheses in a non-pseudo element
  context.

# 1.1.1

* Fixes a crash when a backslash ended a selector string.

# 1.1.0

* Adds support for replacing multiple nodes at once with `replaceWith`
  (thanks to @jonathantneal).
* Parser no longer throws on sequential IDs and trailing commas, to support
  parsing of selector hacks.

# 1.0.1

* Fixes using `insertAfter` and `insertBefore` during iteration.

# 1.0.0

* Adds `clone` and `replaceWith` methods to nodes.
* Adds `insertBefore` and `insertAfter` to containers.
* Stabilises API.

# 0.0.5

* Fixes crash on extra whitespace inside a pseudo selector's parentheses.
* Adds sort function to the container class.
* Enables the parser to pass its input through without transforming.
* Iteration-safe `each` and `eachInside`.

# 0.0.4

* Tidy up redundant duplication.
* Fixes a bug where the parser would loop infinitely on universal selectors
  inside pseudo selectors.
* Adds `length` getter and `eachInside`, `map`, `reduce` to the container class.
* When a selector has been removed from the tree, the root node will no longer
  cast it to a string.
* Adds node type iterators to the container class (e.g. `eachComment`).
* Adds filter function to the container class.
* Adds split function to the container class.
* Create new node types by doing `parser.id(opts)` etc.
* Adds support for pseudo classes anywhere in the selector.

# 0.0.3

* Adds `next` and `prev` to the node class.
* Adds `first` and `last` getters to the container class.
* Adds `every` and `some` iterators to the container class.
* Add `empty` alias for `removeAll`.
* Combinators are now types of node.
* Fixes the at method so that it is not an alias for `index`.
* Tidy up creation of new nodes in the parser.
* Refactors how namespaces are handled for consistency & less redundant code.
* Refactors AST to use `nodes` exclusively, and eliminates excessive nesting.
* Fixes nested pseudo parsing.
* Fixes whitespace parsing.

# 0.0.2

* Adds support for namespace selectors.
* Adds support for selectors joined by escaped spaces - such as `.\31\ 0`.

# 0.0.1

* Initial release.
