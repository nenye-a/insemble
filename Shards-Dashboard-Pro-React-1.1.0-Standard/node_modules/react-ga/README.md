### Demo Code

For a working demo have a look at the [demo files](/demo) or clone this repo and run `npm install` `npm start` then open http://localhost:8080 and follow the instructions.
Demo requires you to have your own TrackingID.

## Upgrading from `1.x` to `2.x`

You can safely upgrade to `2.x` as there are no breaking changes. The main new feature is that the underlying `ga` function is now exposed via the property `ReactGA.ga`. This can be helpful when you need a function that `ReactGA` doesn't support at the moment. Also, for that reason, it is recommended that you rename your imported value as `ReactGA` rather than `ga` so as to distinguish between the React GA wrapper and the original `ga` function.

## Community Components

While some convenience components are included inside the package, some are specific to each application.
A community curated list of these is available in the wiki: DELETED_URL_WITH_CREDENTIALS
