# PostCSS Discard Overridden

[PostCSS] plugin to discard overridden `@keyframes` or `@counter-style`.

`@keyframes` or `@counter-style` will be overridden by those who share the same identifiers and appear later in stylesheets. So we can discard all of them except the last one. When defined inside a `@media` or `@supports` rule, `@keyframes` and `@counter-style` rules only override global rules in some of the client browsers so they need handled separately. This plugin has taken care of this and transforms the PostCss AST **safely**.
